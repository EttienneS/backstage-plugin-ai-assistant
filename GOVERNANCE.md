# Project Governance

This document describes the governance model for the Backstage AI Assistant plugin project.

## Mission and Values

### Mission Statement

### Core Values

- **Quality**: We prioritize reliability, performance, and maintainability
- **Openness**: We develop in the open and welcome community contributions
- **User Focus**: We design for the needs of Backstage users and their organizations
- **Extensibility**: We build with modularity and customization in mind
- **Documentation**: We believe good documentation is as important as good code
- **Inclusivity**: We foster a welcoming and diverse community

## Decision-Making Process

### Consensus Building

We strive for consensus on all decisions. The process:

1. **Proposal**: Issue or discussion opened with detailed proposal
2. **Discussion**: Community provides feedback and alternatives
3. **Iteration**: Proposal refined based on feedback
4. **Consensus**: General agreement from active participants
5. **Implementation**: Work proceeds on the agreed approach

### When Consensus Isn't Reached

For decisions where consensus cannot be reached:

1. **Maintainer Discussion**: Maintainers discuss privately or in dedicated issue
2. **Vote**: If needed, maintainers vote (simple majority)
3. **Final Decision**: Lead maintainer has tie-breaking authority
4. **Documentation**: Decision and rationale documented publicly

### Types of Decisions

#### Minor Decisions

Handled by any committer:

- Bug fixes that don't change behavior
- Documentation improvements
- Code cleanup and refactoring (no API changes)
- Test additions

#### Major Decisions

Require maintainer approval:

- New features
- API changes or deprecations
- Breaking changes
- Architecture modifications
- Changes to contribution process
- Release scheduling

#### Strategic Decisions

Require consensus among maintainers:

- Project direction and roadmap
- Governance changes
- Trademark or brand decisions
- Addition of new maintainers
- Partnership or collaboration decisions

## Communication Channels

### GitHub

Primary platform for project coordination:

- **Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests, tasks
- **Pull Requests**: Code review and contribution
- **Discussions**: Questions, ideas, general discussion
- **Projects**: Roadmap and milestone tracking

### Meetings

Currently, the project operates asynchronously through GitHub. As the community grows, we may establish:

- Regular contributor meetings
- Maintainer sync meetings
- Special topic discussions

Meeting notes will be published publicly.

## Release Process

### Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Release Schedule

- **Patch releases**: As needed for bug fixes
- **Minor releases**: Every 4-8 weeks (as features are ready)
- **Major releases**: As needed for breaking changes

### Release Process

1. **Preparation**: Update CHANGELOG, version numbers, documentation
2. **Testing**: Run full test suite, manual testing of key features
3. **Review**: Maintainer review of changes since last release
4. **Release**: Tag, publish to npm, create GitHub release
5. **Announcement**: Update documentation, announce in community

## Conflict Resolution

### Code of Conduct Violations

Handled according to [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) enforcement guidelines.

### Technical Disputes

1. **Discussion**: Open discussion on the issue
2. **Alternatives**: Consider alternative approaches
3. **Expert Input**: Seek input from domain experts
4. **Decision**: Follow decision-making process above
5. **Document**: Record decision and rationale

### Process Disputes

1. **Raise Concern**: Open issue or discussion
2. **Community Input**: Gather feedback
3. **Maintainer Review**: Maintainers discuss and decide
4. **Update Process**: Modify governance or contributing docs as needed
